# Heart-Failure-Prediction-Using-ML
Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the leading cause of death globally, taking an
estimated 17.9 million lives each year. CVDs are a group of disorders of the heart and
blood vessels and include coronary heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, rheumatic
heart disease and other conditions. More than four out of five CVD deaths are due
to heart attacks and strokes, and one third of these deaths occur prematurely in
people under 70 years of age. People with cardiovascular disease or who are at
high cardiovascular risk (due to the presence of one or more risk factors such as
hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidaemia or already established disease) need early
detection and management wherein a machine learning model can be of great help
for it’s very important to have the capability of predicting if a patient could have an
heart attack considering his CVDs.
The aim of this project is to find the best supervised model to predict if a patient
could have an heart failure or not on the ’heart.csv’ dataset found on kaggle at the
following link which contains 11 features that can be used to predict a possible heart
disease. The most import metrics we look at in order to decide which model perform
the best is the recall as in medical issues is much more important to know who can
have an heart attack then who will not and the recall returns the ability of a classifier
to find all positive instances that, in our case, is the heart failure. In order to do that
we use two classifiers fitted on our dataset which are a Support Vector Machine and
a Feed Forward Neural Network.
